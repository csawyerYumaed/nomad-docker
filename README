UPDATE: nomad has this built in now, don't be a fool, use the built-in stuff.  
This was all written and in production before Nomad had built-in support, we not longer use it.

Nomad's (https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad) docker driver doesn't support volumes.
There is someone that made a "wrapper" around nomad's raw_exec driver to give you volumes, but I didn't care for it.
I wanted a more generic solution
Their solution is here: https://gist.github.com/ketzacoatl/3ccf5bb822df51aed2b896641e931c8a#file-run-postgres
My solution is here.

It's generic, you define network just like always, you define volumes as META labels in your nomad job config.
It's working for me ... in production.

an example job for the docker registry is included in file: registry.nomad.

to INSTALL (must do this on each docker host):
pip install docker-py
cp runNomadDocker.py /usr/local/bin

Then configure your job to run raw_exec and runNomadDocker.py as your command.
Config your mounts, network, image, etc via meta { } config block (details below).

nomad docker doesn't allow us to do volumes, which hurts.
This is a work-around.  I hope they add this soon.

all META keys are capitalized by NOMAD, so be sure to define your _LABELS as uppercase.

the docker container will be removed and stopped, if it's already running.
at exit (nomad stop <job>) time, the docker container will be stopped(but not removed)

for details on configuration see the top of the runNomadDocker.py file, or the example file registry.nomad.
